## Problem Statement

Picking the right outfit can be frustrating — especially when you don’t know if it’ll rain later, get too hot, or suddenly turn windy. People often misjudge the weather or forget what’s already in their closet.

**StyleCast** solves this by recommending weather-appropriate outfits from your closet, factoring in:
- Current weather in your area
- The types of activities you'll be participating in
- (COMING SOON) What clothing you actually own

---

## How It Works

- User logs in or creates an account
- User enters a location and planned activities
- StyleCast retrieves live weather data using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Based on temperature, wind, rain, and weather type, it uses AI to suggest ideal outfits
- Recommends clothes to buy that you can save to your digital closet
- The interface also allows for future outfit planning and trip packing
